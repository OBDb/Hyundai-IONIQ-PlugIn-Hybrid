    description: "The Hyundai IONIQ Plug-in Hybrid was the third and final variant of the first-generation IONIQ lineup, joining the hybrid and electric versions. Featuring the same aerodynamic fastback design as its siblings but distinguished by unique headlights and grille elements, it combined the best aspects of both hybrid and electric powertrains. The system paired a 1.6L GDI four-cylinder engine producing 104 HP with a 60 HP (45 kW) electric motor for a combined output of 139 HP, delivered through a six-speed dual-clutch transmission rather than the CVT typically found in hybrid vehicles. Powered by an 8.9 kWh lithium-ion polymer battery, it offered approximately 29-32 miles of all-electric range (varying by testing standard and model year) before the gasoline engine engaged, allowing for emission-free daily commuting with the flexibility of hybrid operation for longer trips. A full battery charge took about 2.5 hours with a Level 2 charger. The interior featured a modern, clean design with a digital instrument cluster, touchscreen infotainment system, and subtle blue accents to differentiate it from other IONIQ variants. Like the rest of the IONIQ lineup, the Plug-in Hybrid was discontinued in 2022 as Hyundai transitioned to using IONIQ as a dedicated electric vehicle sub-brand. During its production, the IONIQ Plug-in Hybrid offered one of the most efficient plug-in hybrid powertrains on the market, with a total range exceeding 600 miles and combined fuel economy ratings that made it a practical stepping stone between conventional hybrids and full electric vehicles."
